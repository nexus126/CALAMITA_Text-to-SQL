This folder contain :
- a python script for execution accuracy that is "evaluation.py".
- another folder "db_dir/" containing for each database a file of gold queries ("gold.txt") and a file of generated queries("predict.txt").

It is strongly reccomended to read the comments inside "evaluation.py" as they help to run the script in the correct way!
