This folder contain :
- a python script for execution accuracy that is "evaluation.py".
- another folder "db_dir/" containing for each database a file of gold queries ("gold.txt") and a file of generated queries("predict.txt").
- each row of gold.txt and predict.txt must have the following format: [SQL_query  db_name].
- so inside them each row contain a sql query (gold or generated) and the database name (these two are separated by a \tab).
- look inside one of them to better understand the format.
- each "db_name" folder in "db_dir" contains an empty file named predict.txt 
- in corrpesonding to "\db_dir\voli" folder "predict.txt" is not empty but contain the same row as "\dib_dir\gold.txt" in case you want to run the evaluation script for a quick test.
- Remember to clear "\db_dir\voli\predict.txt" content after the quick test or to overwrite it correctly with queries generated by your model.
- In case you generated queries just for some databases and you already want to run the evaluation script only on them you have to modify the "evaluation.py" script (read the comments).
- finally run the "evaluation.py" script on your generated queries and visualize the results.


It is strongly reccomended to read the comments inside "evaluation.py" as they help to run the script in the correct way!
